          <h6>About project :</h6>
          <p>
            The duration of the project was ten hours. The given assignment is
            to work on the communication between the teacher and parent for the
            welfare of their children. After a comprehensive study of the whole
            system and considering the possible intervention points I came up
            with the concept of “educare”.
          </p>
          <h6>The Brief:</h6>
          <p>
            Considering the increasing number of working parents, design an
            application that allows for sharing of homework, feedback, and other
            inputs between teachers and parents on a day-to-day basis.
          </p>
          <h6>The process flow:</h6>
          <p>
            First I started thinking with remembering my kindergarten school
            days. Actually i am from Andhra Pradesh but my daddy got a
            government job in west Bengal so we had to move. That time my mother
            didn't know Bengali which is a regional language there, even thought
            my mom is a homemaker she didn't know Bengali so that she could
            communicate with the teachers and my dad was busy with his job.<br />
            So basing on this situation I have designed the app Which first
            includes making the communication experience simple like if the
            parent don't know English then the parent can convert the message
            into regional language my pressing on the text.<br />
            I have made designs aptly which directly resembles the purpose of
            the app.I first thought of making a chatting sort of interface but
            then got a conclusion that there are a lot many Messenger available
            to chat but this is completely changing the purpose of the app.<br />
            So I designed the app in such a way that the parents and teacher can
            push some notifications basing on the purpose they the using the
            app. The App basically includes four tasks-<br />1) Home work
            <br />2) Feedback <br />3) Seeking permission <br />4) Invitation
            According the school curriculum these are the basic functionalities
            between parents and teacher about the child.
          </p>

            "According to Kementrian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Republik
            Indonesia: The key to the success of education is not only from the
            curriculum and infrastructure that is adequate but also from
            educators such as teachers and parents."

          <h6>Goals:</h6>
          <p>
            Parents of students already have an awareness of the importance of
            attention to children’s development in school, but do not know how
            to do it easily <br />Even if doing so, parents must contact the
            school administration or contact other students’ parents to check
            whether the activity that has been told by the child is correct
            <br />Parents only rely on high “trust” in their children to tell
            all activities in school, but there are still a small number of
            students who do not always tell all their activities to their
            parents. <br />Currently the school has not provided enough
            information about student development that is easily accessible or
            easily known by parents
