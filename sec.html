          <h2>About project :</h2>
          <p>
            The duration of the project was ten hours. The given assignment is
            to work on the door locking security mobile app for people to secure
            their home. After a comprehensive study of the whole system and
            considering the possible intervention points I came up with the
            concept of “Homie Lock”.
          </p>
          <h2>The Brief:</h2>
          <p>
            The recent advancement in smart technology design with integration
            of smart sensors and embedded components has rapidly improved human
            lives in so many areas which includes home automation, smart phones,
            smart healthcare, smart cars and so on. Therefore, smart home
            security demand serious attention and is indispensable in this era
            of internet of things communication over 6LowPAN model using IPv6
            addresses for interconnectivities and endto end links. In this
            paper, the access control, embedded sensors and alarm systems are
            used for safeguard the device facilities in the home automation for
            authentication or authorization and users management over the
            network. However, wireless technology (such as GSM, ultrasonic
            sensor, and Bluetooth low-power enable) was used for controlling and
            monitoring home entrance, user authentication, authorization and
            smart devices management. An android web application was also
            developed and integrate with the system for home user control
            remotely. This developed system was equipped with a strict access
            control and password security features for an intruder denial or
            violation and also keep the neighbor’s alert of possible human
            attacks.
          </p>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            “The smart home devices are not difficult to understand; it’s the
            apps that are too stressful to use, too unpredictable in their
            behaviour, too overloaded with unnecessary functions.”
          </p>
          <h2>Goals:</h2>
          <p>
            From this I have started to design the home security system. I have
            studied the requirements and drawn four main features basing on the
            objective given in the mail. They are:<br />1) One time use <br />2)
            Restricted to particular time every day <br />3) Restricted to
            particular days of the week.
          </p>
          <h2>User Journey Mapping:</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>8:30 AM</strong> - Sai wakes up and gets ready for the
            office. He have his breakfast and gone to office. Even his father
            gone to office with him.<br /><strong>9:00 AM</strong>- Sai’s mom
            gone to market to get vegitables. She took one of the lock with her
            as his sister have to go to college at 10:00 AM, so she have to lock
            the door and leave.<br /><strong>12:00 PM</strong> – Eats lunch (sai
            and his father).<br /><strong>2:00 PM</strong> - Sai’s mom got a
            phone call from her friend and she asked her to come to her home to
            have some conversation.<br /><strong>4:30 PM</strong> – The
            conversation took so time that Sai’s mom forgot about going home as
            her husband and son both will get back to home.<br />
            This is how the problem arises.
          </p>
          <h2>Problem analysis:</h2>
          <p>
            1) The people in the family have diversified lives.<br />2) Key
            management (as the families will not have that many spare keys).<br />
            3) For this an app which can make their life easier and help them to
            manage keys, provided the security is ensured.
          </p>
          <h2>User case:</h2>
          <p>
            1) The user opens the app and selects weather he is an admin or a
            member in the family. If he selects as a member then he have get an
            OTP or have to scan the QR code from the admin app.<br />
            2) The user can sign with Gmail or Facebook or even register with
            the app.<br />3) Once the app is opened it will be having four
            sections:<br />
            i) Door locking. <br />
            ii) Sharing keys section.<br />
            iii) Received key section.<br />
            iv) Managing the shared keys.<br />4) The user can to whatever the
            tasks mentioned in the particular section.<br />
            i) The user access the door locking section if he wants to open or
            close the door. If the door is opened for 3 minutes a notification
            will be given to the user.<br />
            ii) The user access the sharing keys section if he wants to share a
            key with his known person.<br />
            iii) The user access the received key section if the user wants the
            key of the received user home.<br />
            iv) The user access the managing the shared key section if the wants
            to withdraw the key or see the details of the persons who he has
            shared the key.
