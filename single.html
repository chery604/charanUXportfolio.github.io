            About project :
          </h3>
          <p>
            The duration of the project was one month. I chose to work on saving
            time in finding the products in a mall. After a comprehensive study
            of the whole system and considering the possible intervention points
            I came up with the concept of “Gateway”.
          </p>

          <h3>
            The Brief:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Considering the growth of fashion and other diversity ecommerce
            products, study the overall System and propose a solution to reduce
            the time in searching rather than actual shopping.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Problem Statement:
          </h3>
          <p>
            thousand visitors come to a shopping mall every day. Not only do
            visitors quickly lose track of what's going on there and quickly
            miss good and current offers, or find the toilets with their
            children not quickly enough. In addition, the shops in the
            multi-stored shopping centers are not even found; and it is
            particularly problematic for parents whose children can no longer be
            found or the car cannot be located in the large car park, even after
            a long search.
          </p>
          <h3>
            The process:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Basing on the result of the feature of the indoor navigation I have
            drawn down some features to reduce the time in shopping even-<br /><br />
            1) The app will we have a ecommerce facility in which the customer
            can search for item which he wants and once if he tap on navigate
            button the app with open the indoor navigation system and navigate
            the customer to the desired shop and meanwhile the shop owner will
            be getting notification of the customer going to visit the shop for
            the particular product so that the shop owner would keep the product
            for the customer. re- Initially, I started off with a small research
            on which it described the problem statement and found that basing on
            using the indoor navigation system the task can be done in an easier
            manner for the customer.<br /><br />2) The app will keep track of
            your car where it has been parked.<br /><br />3) Meanwhile the
            customer is shopping, he can order some eatables in the app itself
            and mention the time of arrival to the shop so that the shopkeeper
            will keep the food ready for him.
          </p>

            Swot analysis:
          </h3>
          <p>
            forms of positioning are shaping up to be big business. A recent
            report from the research firm Markets and estimates the indoor
            location market – which includes indoor navigation as well as indoor
            data tracking (such as how long someone spends in a specific store
            in the mall) – will be worth $41 billion by 2022. Another report,
            from Opus Research, estimated that, as of 2014, there were some 200
            startups working on indoor navigation systems.
          </p>
          <h3>Challenges:</h3>
          <p>
            1) Distributing real-time offers to customers as per category<br />2)
            Device compatibility for existing and next generation
            smartphones.<br />3) Delivering unified user experience.<br />4)
            Incorporating indoor location based functions.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Business research:
          </h3>
          <p>
            The report "Indoor Location Market by Component (Technology,
            Software Tools, and Services), Deployment Mode (Cloud, and
            On-premises), Application, Vertical (Transportation, Hospitality,
            Entertainment, Retail, and Public Buildings), and Region - Global
            Forecast to 2022", The global indoor location market expected to
            grow from USD 7.11 Billion in 2017 to USD 40.99 Billion by 2022, at
            a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 42.0% during the forecast
            period. Hassle-free navigation, improved decision-making, and
            increased adoption of connected devices are boosting the growth of
            the indoor location market across the globe.<br /><br />2) Location
            analytics segment of software tools is expected to dominate the
            indoor location market during the forecast period. Among the
            software tools, location analytics is the expected to have the
            largest market size in the during the forecast period. Location
            analytics is a business intelligence process to generate insights
            from location-based data. Location analytics converts raw data as
            per the specific location into valuable insights through a more
            visual approach. Location analytics analyze data collected from
            indoor locations such as retail stores, stadiums, airports, and
            other locations.<br /><br />3) The Asia Pacific (APAC) region is
            expected to witness the highest growth rate in the indoor location
            market during the forecast period. APAC is expected to have the
            highest growth rate during the forecast period, due to the adoption
            of indoor location by users and verticals in the region. China,
            Australia, New Zealand, and India are the frontrunners in adopting
            indoor location via connected devices such as smart phones, tablets,
            and smart watches. Additionally, the APAC region has the presence of
            a pool of social media users in China, India, and Australia.
          </p>
          <h3>User Archtypes:</h3>
          <p>
            According to a 2016 Study digital services are much asked for by
            customer:<br />1)Two thirds of the visitors inform themselves about
            the center via app and website before the visit.<br />2)arrival
            services(84%)and information on-site(86%) are highly relevent.<br />3)Each
            fourth client wants to use a 3D guidance system among people under
            40 it is even each third.
          </p>
          <h3>User Advatages</h3>
          <p>
            The user can know: <br />1)Where can i find what?<br />2) what
            current offer are there?<br />3) How to i get to my desired
            store?<br />Indoor navigation as well as other services make the
            shopping experience more enjoyable and enrich the customer.
          </p>
          <h3>Retailer Advantages:</h3>
          <p>
            There are also a wide range of display options for stores and
            restaurants. Opening times, photos, information on the product range
            and contact options increase visibility enormously. Using
            location-based marketing, retailers reach their target group
            directly: additional purchase incentives can be employed independent
            of the location and interests of the user, e.g. via push messages
            and coupons. The "Around me" function provides an overview of all
            stores in the user's environment.
