          <h3>About project :</h3>
          <p>
            The duration of the project was one month. I chose to work
            onenhancing the experience of online shopping using eCommerce app.
            After acomprehensive study of the whole system and considering the
            possibleintervention points I came up with the concept “Tapme“.
          </p>
          <h3>The Brief:</h3>
          <p>
            Considering the stunted growth of the eCommerce online shopping,
            study the overall system of enhancing the customer experience while
            shopping online.
          </p>
          <h3>The process:</h3>
          <p>
            Initially, I started off with eCommerce research whichincluded what
            are the common issues faced by users at the time of onlineshopping.
            Basing on the research I have drawn down some features to make
            theuser experience a comfortable one:<br />1) The user is given
            accessto shop online with the friends even though they are apart.
            The app willconnect them with a common interface to suggest items to
            their friends. Thefriends will be connected in a voice call or video
            call.<br />2) The user is given afeature of adding a 3d avatar of
            their body for that-<br />
            i) at first, the face of the user is tracked and a 3d cartoon
            figureis generated.<br />
            ii)the user is asked to fill the details of the measurements sothat
            a 3d human resembling the user is created so that to give the
            feature of“trial room” i.e. once the user click on try dress the
            will generate a 3d human the character of the user so that he could
            check how he going to look on thatdress.<br />3) The app is
            integrated with a messenger so that the communitycan be developed
            easily. The messenger includes: <br />
            i) Theuser can make a partial meeting with her friends for some time
            while shoppingtogether so that they could chat while shopping, or
            present in a group call.Once the meeting gets over all the chat
            content can be destroyed.<br />
            ii) The app supports chatting, video calls, audio calls.

          <h3>Businness research:</h3>
          <p>
            India’s rapid growth, across a range of frontiers, appears to be
            good news for global consumer businesses seeking to access its
            markets. Internet proliferation, as well as increasing uses of
            online shopping channels, pose new opportunities to reach consumers.
            A new PwC study highlights that more people are buying online, with
            debit cards the most common way to pay for online goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Indian consumer goods market has seen steady growth in recent
            decades. The country has a relatively young and increasingly
            technology savvy population, with 40% of the recently breached 1.25
            billion inhabitants aged between 25 and 54, 18% between 15 and 24,
            and 28% aged below 15. As GDP growth is projected to remain above 7%
            in the coming years, the country with its young population continues
            to represent an area of opportunity for businesses.
          </p>
          <h3>Reason for integrating messenger in the ecommerce app-</h3>
          <p>
            Messaging Goals: <br />• the number of Internet users increased by
            100 million to a total of 560 million.<br />
            • 89% of Internet users use messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook
            Messenger, Viber & Co.<br />
            • WhatsApp is at the top of mobile apps among monthly active users.
            <br />• Facebook Messenger was the most downloaded app in 2018.
            Primarily, messaging. 91% of Indian internet users use mobile
            messengers. This usage statistic actually ranks messaging apps as
            more highly-used than YouTube: watching videos on mobile is the 2nd
            place activity, followed by map services, playing games, and then
            mobile banking.
          </p>
          <h1>
            “In the last years, the Indian mobile messaging audience grew by 113
            per cent, we expect the number of mobile messaging users to continue
            to grow in the coming quarters,”
          </h1>
          <p>
            The report also revealed that the increasing popularity of messaging
            apps is driving users away from social networking sites such as
            Facebook. “Mobile messaging tools like WeChat and WhatsApp have seen
            substantial growth during recent period. Social networks are being
            treated more passively, meaning the number of people messaging
            friends on social networks has declined. People see mobile messaging
            apps as an efficient way to communicate,” explained GlobalWebIndex
            Head of Trends Jason Mander.
